<h1>Belly Button Biodiversity</h1>

The dashboard is build with JavaScript and contains a dropdown menu with individuals ID's, bar graph displaying the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, bubble chart that displays each sample, demographics panel and gauge chart displaying the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

All of the charts are automatically updated whenever a new sample is selected.
